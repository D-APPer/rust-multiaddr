# rust-multiaddr

Another version of MultiAddr written in Rust, I felt the other one was a bit too Verbose for my taste so as my first real Rust project I decided to try and do a rewrite of it to see if I could improve on a few features. 

The current state is unfinished. Hopefully will get more time to finish up in the near future.
